# SmartAgricultureSystem
C++ code that performs the operations requested in the background of the agricultural fertilization and spraying simulation named Smart Agriculture, within certain rules.


The scenario of the simulation named Smart Agriculture is as follows:

In this simulation, a farmer has 6 fields. Farmer planted in his field with his smart tractor
By following the shortest path to the needs of 6 different fields (irrigation, spraying, fertilization, hoeing)
wishes to meet. In this way, it saves both cost and time and produces environmentally friendly agricultural products.
aims to carry out activities.

Things to do in the simulation called Smart Agriculture:

Scan the Field: The smart tractor travels the entire field from the starting point on the field to meet the needs.
determines. During this scan it can determine which field needs what. smart tractor,
makes a ranking according to the priorities of the fields.

Satisfy Needs: The smart tractor enters the fields in this order and performs irrigation, fertilization, spraying,
makes the hoeing operations.
